# RNA-seq Differential Expression Pipeline

This repository implements a reproducible RNA-seq differential expression workflow using **Galaxy** and **R (DESeq2)**.  
The pipeline processes raw FASTQ reads through quality control, alignment, quantification, and statistical analysis to identify differentially expressed genes.



## üìå Project Overview
- **Input**: Raw FASTQ RNA-seq data (small test dataset from [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) or Galaxy Training Network).  
- **Steps**:
  1. Quality Control (FastQC, Trimmomatic)
  2. Alignment (HISAT2)
  3. Quantification (FeatureCounts)
  4. Differential Expression Analysis (DESeq2 in R)
  5. Visualization (Volcano plot, PCA, Heatmap)

- **Output**: List of differentially expressed genes + plots for interpretation.



## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Linux/Unix** (file handling, pipeline scripting)
- **Galaxy** (workflow execution)
- **R / Bioconductor** (DESeq2, ggplot2, pheatmap)
- **Python** (optional: matplotlib/seaborn for visualization)
- **GitHub** (version control & reproducibility)

- R ‚â• 4.0 with DESeq2
- Galaxy or local tools (FastQC, HISAT2, featureCounts)

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

### 2. Add `.gitignore` (Python + R)

Create a `.gitignore` file in the root:

```gitignore
# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
*.pkl
*.egg-info/
.env
.venv/
build/
dist/
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# R
.Rhistory
.RData
.Rproj.user/
.Ruserdata
*.Rproj
*.Rhistory
*.RData
*.Rout
.Rapp.history

# OS / Misc
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
